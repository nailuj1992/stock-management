# Stock Management #

This basic project was built on PHP using the framework Yii. This project was focused on manage the stock for a company: inputs, outputs, stock management, and kardex.

**Note:** When you clone the project, you need to get the *vendor/* directory. That's why you can see a zipped file named **vendor.zip**, so you need to unzip it and put the content into a new folder called *vendor/*
